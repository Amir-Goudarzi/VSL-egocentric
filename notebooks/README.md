# VSL egocentric notebooks

## Requirements
The notebooks are run on google colab. [Keys](https://ego4d-data.org/docs/start-here/) for EGO4D dataset are needed and should be added to your google colab environment as ```aws_access_key``` and ```aws_secret_key```.

In this project we save our results as persistant storage in google drive. The folder structure is as follows:

    MyDrive/vsl-egocentric
    ├── ego4d_data
    ├── extension
    ├── pre-extracted-features
    ├── runs
    └── glove.840B.300d.txt
